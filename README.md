# Participation in Mobile Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2019.

Side notes: 
- I am not familiar with native Auto Layout, I usually use SnapKit or Texture/AsyncDisplayKit.
- I didn't fully understand navigation and UI of the contest app and did what as understood
- Made it in MVC to reduce time, if it's going to be scaling up, I will do in MVP at least

Mobile was app created by Dosbol Duysekov. Thank your for checking out.
